# Olist E-Commerce Data Analysis


## Introduction
I participated in a data challenge hosted by the Twitter data community in April. The assignment involved analyzing data from Olist, a well-known Brazilian e-commerce company. This dataset contained critical information regarding Olist's operations, such as product listings, sellers, and customer interactions. My goal was to look through the information and find helpful insights based on certain questions. The dataset was rigorously vetted and prepared by the challenge organizers to ensure that participants like me could extract important information and obtain insights related to Olist's company. This project challenge aims to accomplish the following objectives:
- To increase accuracy and usability, validate and sanitize the data.
- Analyze the data in order to answer the problem statement 
- Make recommendations to the Olist corporation.

## Dataset Description
This challenge's dataset was obtained from the KAGGLE website. You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) . It contains statistics on 100k orders placed on several Brazilian marketplaces between 2016 and 2018. The Olist dataset comprises nine separate datasets, all of which are stored in CSV format:

- olist_order_items_dataset
- olist_orders_dataset
- olist_order_payments_dataset
- olist_order_reviews_dataset
- olist_products_dataset
- olist_customers_dataset
- olist_sellers_dataset
- olist_geolocation_dataset
- olist_category_dataset

The olist [Data Dictionary](https://github.com/EmmanuelOrunta/Data-Challenge/blob/main/Olist%20Data%20Dictionary.pdf) provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset. This data dictionary is a useful resource because it includes detailed descriptions of each variable and its significance in the dataset. It is a great tool for properly analyzing and interpreting data.
