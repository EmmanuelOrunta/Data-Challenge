# Olist E-Commerce Data Analysis


## Introduction
I participated in a data challenge hosted by the Twitter data community in April. The assignment involved analyzing data from Olist, a well-known Brazilian e-commerce company. This dataset contained critical information regarding Olist's operations, such as product listings, sellers, and customer interactions. My goal was to look through the information and find helpful insights based on certain questions. The dataset was rigorously vetted and prepared by the challenge organizers to ensure that participants like me could extract important information and obtain insights related to Olist's company. This project challenge aims to accomplish the following objectives:
-  To increase accuracy and usability, validate and sanitize the data.
- Analyze the data in order to answer the problem statement 
- Make recommendations to the Olist corporation.
