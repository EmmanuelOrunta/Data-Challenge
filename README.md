# Olist E-Commerce Data Analysis


## Introduction
I participated in a data challenge hosted by the Twitter data community in April. The assignment involved analyzing data from Olist, a well-known Brazilian e-commerce company. This dataset contained critical information regarding Olist's operations, such as product listings, sellers, and customer interactions. My goal was to look through the information and find helpful insights based on certain questions. The dataset was rigorously vetted and prepared by the challenge organizers to ensure that participants like me could extract important information and obtain insights related to Olist's company. This project challenge aims to accomplish the following objectives:
- To increase accuracy and usability, validate and sanitize the data.
- Analyze the data in order to answer the problem statement 
- Make recommendations to the Olist corporation.

## Dataset Description
This challenge's dataset was obtained from the KAGGLE website. You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) . It contains statistics on 100k orders placed on several Brazilian marketplaces between 2016 and 2018. The Olist dataset comprises nine separate datasets, all of which are stored in CSV format:

- olist_order_items_dataset
- olist_orders_dataset
- olist_order_payments_dataset
- olist_order_reviews_dataset
- olist_products_dataset
- olist_customers_dataset
- olist_sellers_dataset
- olist_geolocation_dataset
- olist_category_dataset

The olist [Data Dictionary](https://github.com/EmmanuelOrunta/Data-Challenge/blob/main/Olist%20Data%20Dictionary.pdf) provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset. This data dictionary is a useful resource because it includes detailed descriptions of each variable and its significance in the dataset. It is a great tool for properly analyzing and interpreting data.

## Outline Of This Challenge

- Data Cleaning, Data Validation
- Answer Business Questions and Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
- Share Insights and Make recommendations

### Data Cleaning and Data Validation
I explored the 9 different tables with Excel and from this process, I discovered the dataset had the following quality issues:

- **Null & Empty values**
  
  After checking for null values, there are 610 records with null values in the category, name_length, descriptn_len, and photos_qty columns of the products table.
I used the Update function to replace the null values in the category with N/A, and 0 with null values in the name_length, descriptn_len, and photos_qty columns.

- **Unwanted special characters and Proper Formatting**
  
  I replaced unwanted characters in the Geolocation table using the update/replace function, and I also capitalized the first letter of the geolocation city column to give the right formatting with the substring function

- **Wrong Data Types**

  I noticed this issue in some columns of the orders, payment, reviews, and items table and I addressed this issue by altering the the data types of the affected columns in the respective tables

- Updating of Column Names
  There are records in the category column that I had to update with English-translated versions of the Portuguese strings from the category_name_translatn table, but after confirming the distinct records from the translation table, I discovered three category records in the products table that I did not find in the translation table.
The first is pc_gamer, the second is portateis_cozinha_e_preparadores_de_alimentos, and the third is the Null entry from the products table.
